# render3D
This module source code is part of a software that  renders multiple 3D objects (logs) using OpenGL and performs matching and measurements on the data. Note that this is not a build and run source code, but merely a frustum that can be adapted to specific needs.

       CT (Computed Tomography) Tomolog3DMatching and 3D-Shape Visualization Software (3D-Shape1 measures
       the log with bark , CT also with bark, and 3D-Shape in debarked status). It provides also an 
       interface for testing measurment deviations on pre-build testing engines provided by scientific log research.
       Tested in real-time environment at Hasslacher sawmill corporation, Sachsenburg (A);

       STATEMENT
       This set of algorithms have been implemented for a custom measurment system in the log industry,
       Major parts have been also implemented in spare-time activity. In this way, I personally claim some copyright 
       on this code. 
 
       This module implements 3D rendering algorithms, as well as log-data searching-features in order to
       match heterogenuous log data of all spicies, leading to expanding research possibilities as well as to
       automatition production businesses.

       This software renders 3D-Shape Data and CT of the logs with, and without bark. Note that this
       might not be an easy task as the logs in bark, can eaven have debarked parts.
       Once the matching has occurred, the XRay projection is also rendered as volume data. In this way
       We get a true correlation between the 3 different measures. Huge chunks of image files can be
       analyzed and results being printed to a file, typically comma separated row-alignment.
